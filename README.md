# Learning-new-programming-language
## Hello, I am learning elixir programming language. I thanks to MLH:LHD to give this challenge otherwise i might have studied this.

# Here's the syntax for my first program in elixir ðŸ‘Ž

```elixir
IO.puts("Hello, World!")
```

## ðŸ¤” What is Elixir?

Elixir is a functional, dynamically typed, concurrent general-purpose programming language created by
*JosÃ© Valim*. It is built on the top of an Erlang virtual machine which is known for running low latency,
distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. Elixir compiles down to Erlang's bytecode. Since its release in
2011, it has become one of the most loved languages, because Elixir applications are scalable, very reliable,
and syntax is also nice.

## ðŸ¤· Why to use Elixir?

* **Scalability** - Elixir code runs inside lightweight threads of execution (called processes) that are isolated and exchange information via messages.  Isolation allows processes to be garbage collected independently, reducing system-wide pauses, and using all machine resources as efficiently as possible (vertical scaling).

* **Fault-Tolerance** - To cope with failures, Elixir provides supervisors which describe how to restart parts of your system when things go bad. The combination of fault-tolerance and event-driven programming via message passing makes Elixir an excellent choice for reactive programming and robust architectures.

* **Functional** - Functional programming promotes a coding style that helps developers write code that is short, concise, and maintainable. In Elixir immutable data structures help concurrency quite a lot, and pattern matching is great for writing declarative code.

* **Dynamic Typing** - Dynamic typing means that types are checked in run-time, not during compilation. This increases the development speed for simple web and mobile applications. In Elixir, static types can be introduced in Elixir through typespecs.


## Companies using Elixir

### **WhatsApp**

WhatsApp provides messaging services to more than 1 billion people around the world, and they do all this having a really small team

### **Adobe**

Adobe used Elixir in production to create a client/cloud app for a collaborative photography workflow.

### **Discord**

Instant messaging app for video, voice calls and text chats chose Elixir to build a large-scale messaging system with over 5 million concurrent users.

## Conclusion

If want to build a robust, fault-tolerant scalable project with a small team, then Elixir is the best weapon for you.
